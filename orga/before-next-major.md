# before next major release

This list contains things that have to be done but will create breaking changes.


### Rewrite prototype-merge

Each collection creates it's own constructor for RxDocuments.
This has a performance-benefit over using the Proxy-API which is also not supported in IE11.
To create the constructor, the collection merges prototypes from RxDocument, RxSchema and the ORM-functions.
The current implementation of this prototype-merging is very complicated and has hacky workarrounds to work with vue-devtools.
We should rewrite it to a single pure function that returns the constructor.
Instead of mergin the prototype into a single object, we should chain them together.

### Refactor data-migrator

 - The current implemetation does not use pouchdb's bulkDocs which is much faster
 - This could have been done in much less code which would be easier to uderstand

## Move rxjs into a plugin instead of having it internal
RxDB relies heavily on rxjs. This made it easy in the past to handle the data flow inside of RxDB and also created feature-rich interfaces for users when they want to observe data.
As long as you have rxjs in your project anyways, like you would have in an angular project, there is no problem with that.
As soon as a user has another data-handling library like redux or mobx, rxjs increases the build size by 22kb (5kb gzipped) and also adds the burden to map rxjs observables into the own state management.

The change would ensure that rxjs is no longer used inside of RxDB. And also there will be a RxDB-plugin which offers the same observable-features as there are today, but optional.
This would also allow us to create plugins for mobx or react-hooks in the future.
## Make RxDocument-acessors functions

Things like `RxDocument.deleted$` or `RxDocument.$` should be functions instead of getters.
We apply a hack atm which does not really work with typescript.

## Make RxDcouments immutable
At the current version of RxDB, RxDocuments mutate themself when they recieve ChangeEvents from the database.
For example when you have a document where `name = 'foo'` and some update changes the state to `name = 'bar'` in the database, then the previous javascript-object will change it's own property to the have `doc.name === 'bar'`.
This feature is great when you use a RxDocument with some change-detection like in angular or vue templates. You can use document properties directly in the template and all updates will be reflected in the view, without having to use observables or subscriptions.

However this behavior is also confusing many times. When the state in the database is changed, it is not clear at which exact point of time the objects attribute changes. Also the self-mutating behavior created some problem with vue- and react-devtools because of how they clone objects.

Also, to not confuse with fast changes that happen directly after each other, the whole json-data-to-RxDocument-piple has to be synchronous. With the change, this can be async which will allow us to have async post-result-transformations, like an asynchronous encryption plugin (with the Web Crypto API) or also move things into a webworker.

The change would make all RxDocuments immutable. When you subscribe to a query and the same document is returned in the results, this will always be a new javascript object.

## Remove deprecated 'recieved' methods.
See [#3392](https://github.com/pubkey/rxdb/pull/3392)

# Maybe

## Use Proxy instead of getters/setter on RxDocument
Currently there is a hack invovled into the proxy-get-methods like `myDocument.firstName$` etc.
This had to be done because IE11 does not support the Proxy-Object (and there is no way to polyfill).
If we give up IE11-Support, we could use the proxy-object which would also allow to directly mutate arrays like described in [#561](https://github.com/pubkey/rxdb/issues/561). This would also give a performance-benefit.
